## Random Developer Tidbits
1. The first versions of this application used pure Windows Forms. This has been changed so now the application uses WPF as well for some of the more complicated screens. The legacy UI is located in the UI folder of the MitchHotkeys project. To change the application to use the legacy Windows Forms again, change the constant in Constants.cs.
2. The autotune hotkey is experimental and not expected to work.
